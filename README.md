# Ruflo

**Multi-agent AI orchestration for Claude Code**

</div>

Orchestrate 100+ specialized AI agents across machines, teams, and trust boundaries. Ruflo adds coordinated swarms, self-learning memory, federated comms, and enterprise security to Claude Code — so agents don't just run, they collaborate.

### Why Ruflo?

> Claude Flow is now Ruflo — named by Ruv, who loves Rust, flow states, and building things that feel inevitable. The "Ru" is the Ruv. The "flo" is the flow. Underneath, WASM kernels written in Rust power the policy engine, embeddings, and proof system. 

### What Ruflo Does

One `init` gives Claude Code a nervous system: agents self-organize into swarms, learn from every task, remember across sessions, and — with federation — securely talk to agents on other machines without leaking data. You keep writing code. Ruflo handles the coordination.

```
Self-Learning / Self-Optimizing Agent Architecture

User --> Ruflo (CLI/MCP) --> Router --> Swarm --> Agents --> Memory --> LLM Providers
                          ^                           |
                          +---- Learning Loop <-------+
```

> **New to Ruflo?** You don't need to learn 314 MCP tools or 26 CLI commands. After `init`, just use Claude Code normally -- the hooks system automatically routes tasks, learns from successful patterns, and coordinates agents in the background.

### Agent Federation — Slack for Agents

```
Your Agent --> [ Remove secrets ] --> [ Sign message ] --> [ Encrypted channel ]
                 Emails, SSNs,        Proves it came       No one reads it
                 keys stripped         from you              in transit
                                                                |
                                                                v
Their Agent <-- [ Block attacks ] <-- [ Check identity ] <------+
                 Stops prompt          Rejects forgeries
                 injection

                          Audit trail on both sides.
                  Trust builds over time. Bad behavior = instant downgrade.
```

Slack gave teams channels. Federation gives agents the same thing — **shared workspaces across trust boundaries**, where agents on different machines, orgs, or cloud regions can discover each other, prove who they are, and collaborate on tasks.

The difference: some channels are trusted, some aren't. [`@claude-flow/plugin-agent-federation`](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo/issues/1669) handles that automatically. Your agents join a federation, get verified via mTLS + ed25519, and start exchanging work — with PII stripped before anything leaves your node and every message auditable. Untrusted agents can still participate at lower privilege: they see discovery info, not your memory. As they prove reliable, trust upgrades. If they misbehave, they get downgraded instantly — no human in the loop required.

You don't configure handshakes or manage certificates. You `federation init`, `federation join`, and your agents start talking. The protocol handles identity, the PII pipeline handles data safety, and the audit trail handles compliance.

<details>
<summary><strong>Federation capabilities</strong></summary>

| | Capability | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| 🔒 | **Zero-trust federation** | Remote agents start untrusted. Identity proven via mTLS + ed25519 challenge-response. No API keys, no shared secrets. |
| 🛡️ | **PII-gated data flow** | 14-type detection pipeline scans every outbound message. Per-trust-level policies: BLOCK, REDACT, HASH, or PASS. Adaptive calibration reduces false positives. |
| 📊 | **Behavioral trust scoring** | Formula (`0.4×success + 0.2×uptime + 0.2×threat + 0.2×integrity`) continuously evaluates peers. Upgrades require history; downgrades are instant. |
| 📋 | **Compliance built-in** | HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR audit trails as compliance modes. Every federation event produces a structured record searchable via HNSW. |
| 🤝 | **9 MCP tools + 10 CLI commands** | Full lifecycle: `federation_init`, `federation_send`, `federation_trust`, `federation_audit`, and more. |

<summary><strong>Example: two teams sharing fraud signals without sharing customer data</strong></summary>

```bash
# Team A: initialize federation and generate keypair
npx claude-flow@latest federation init

# Team A: join Team B's federation endpoint
npx claude-flow@latest federation join wss://team-b.example.com:8443

# Team A: send a task — PII is stripped automatically before it leaves
npx claude-flow@latest federation send --to team-b --type task-request \
  --message "Analyze transaction patterns for account anomalies"

# Team A: check peer trust levels and session health
npx claude-flow@latest federation status
